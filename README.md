# Dimensionality-Reduction
Dimensionality Reduction is the process of removing the number of features in a dataset which makes the learning faster, simpler, and prevents overfitting to a certain extent.
## Step 1
### Normalization
The process of getting all the numerical features between the range of 0 and 1
We use MinMaxScaler() to fit and transform the values.
### Standardisation 
Getting the data to result in a Mean = 0 and Standard Deviation = 1. This is to make sure that the data follows a  normal distribution.
## Step 2
